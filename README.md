# RAUM

RAUM means "space" in German. This name represents our goal: to create virtual spaces that enable better communication and socialization. It’s short, easy to remember, and attention-grabbing.

## Project Purpose

RAUM addresses the issue of socialization challenges, particularly for individuals with intellectual disabilities (ID). These individuals often struggle in daily life due to a lack of opportunities to practice social and independent living skills. This can limit their participation in society and impact their quality of life.

**RAUM is a freemium solution** that allows individuals to learn social skills in inclusive and enriching virtual environments. We also plan to include relevant advertising, such as events for people with disabilities organized by associations.
